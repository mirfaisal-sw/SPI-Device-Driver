SPI device concepts: -
=======================

1. In Linux SPI device is detected as "spidevB.C".
   Here B means Bus number and C means Chip select nummber.
   
   If suppose a SOC has spi module spi0 and it has two chip 
   select line spi0_cs0 and spi0_cs1.
   
   If SPI device is connected at spi0_cs0, then Linux will treat
   this with name "spi1.0".
   Bus number = SPI module number of H/w + 1.
